Please be so kind as to send my a quick message on LinkedIn if you are using some of my research (https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-g√§rtner-at-hdi/). Further source code can be shared upon request (yes you can have it; it is just not that great that I want to publish it). Unfortunately the raw data is copyright protected. If you can get hold of it, I can show you how to reproduce my results.
